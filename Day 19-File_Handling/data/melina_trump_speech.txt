From a young age, my parents impressed on me the values that you work hard for what you want in life.
That your word is your bond, and you do what you say and keep your promise.
We need to pass those lessons on to the many generations to follow.
Because we want our children in this nation to know the only limit to your achievements is the strength of your dreams.
