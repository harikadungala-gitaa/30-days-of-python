My fellow Americans, tonight, after two hundred and twenty years, our democracy has once again been made whole.
Change will not come if we wait for some other person or some other time.
We are the ones we've been waiting for. We are the change that we seek.
Let us begin the work of remaking America.
Yes we can.
