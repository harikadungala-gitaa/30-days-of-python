# 30 Days of Python

This repository documents my learning progress for the **30 Days of Python** course by [Asabeneh](https://github.com/Asabeneh/30-Days-Of-Python), as part of my study plan under GITAA.

Each folder (Day_01, Day_02, etc.) contains the exercises and code I’ve completed daily.

A virtual environment is used for all practice files, and progress is regularly pushed to GitHub.
